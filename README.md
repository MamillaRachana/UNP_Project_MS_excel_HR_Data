# UNP_Project_MS_excel_HR_Data

I'm excited to present my latest project with UNP education – an interactive Attrition Dashboard built with Excel, aimed at assisting organizations in optimizing employee retention strategies. Attrition, the departure of employees over time, serves as a vital metric for organizational health, offering insights into the effectiveness of HR policies and employee satisfaction.

This dynamic dashboard offers HR teams comprehensive insights into attrition rates, revealing patterns and potential areas of concern. An outstanding feature allows users to filter data across three key departments – HR, R&D, and Sales. This functionality enables a detailed analysis of Attrition trends based on various KPI's, offering valuable information for tailoring strategies to enhance employee retention.
